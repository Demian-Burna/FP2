- Setting up the project structure
- Adding configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Implementing the initial codebase

## Development Commands

*To be updated once the project technology stack is determined*

## Architecture Overview

*To be updated as the project architecture is designed and implemented*
